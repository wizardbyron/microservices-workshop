# microservices-workshop

A Microservices Workshop Spring Cloud and Kubernetes.

## Before you start

You need to install following software to finish this workshop:

- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
- IDE like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) or [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
- [MySQL Community](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)

- [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)
- [JDK-8](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)

## Step 0: Clone this repo

Be sure that you have enough storage space (1~2 GB) and memory (2 GB). 

And clone this repo via `https://github.com/wizardbyron/microservices-workshop`.

Then checkout the step 1 via `git checkout step-1`.

## Step 1: Create an user management API to access database.

Our goal now to create a basic Spring Boot API for user management. We can use this API do CRUD operations on a mysql database.

Tasks:

1. Create a Spring boot API.
2. Create a local mysql instance.
3. Create user and database in mysql.

[Spring Guides](https://spring.io/guides) has many beginner projects in good code taste and enginnering practices. We can start from them.

Now we are going to start the journey from [Accessing data with MySQL](https://spring.io/guides/gs/accessing-data-mysql/).

You need to clone the repo via `git clone https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-accessing-data-mysql.git`.

You can following the guide start from `init` folder. But we just need `complete` folder for a quick win.

Use your IDE or editor open the folder.

Create a local mysql instance with creadentials and database name in the `application.properties` file.

You can use **MySQL Wrokbench** to connect your local MySQL instance as root to create database and user:

```SQL
CREATE database db_example;
CREATE USER 'springuser'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'ThePassword';
GRANT ALL ON msdb.* TO 'springuser'@'%';
GRANT USAGE ON msdb.* TO 'springuser'@'%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

Now you can start your spring application from IDE or `./gradlew bootRun`.

`./gradlew` is a script means `gradle wrapper`, it will download gradle wrapper in the project folder to help you automated tasks. You can list all tasks via `./gradlew tasks`.

After a few seconds(or minutes), you can test the API from `PostMan` or `curl` by making a request to `http://localhost:8080/demo/all`.

If you get a `[]` which means an empty array, you have setup the API. Let's add a user.

Now you you can made a GET request to `http://localhost:8080/demo/add?name=test_user&email=test_user@google.com` to add a new user. It will response `Saved` to you.

You can verify the request by accessing database via `select * from user` in MySQL Workbench or make a new query request to `http://localhost:8080/demo/all` to get the user message you add.

It will response a JSON like:

```JSON
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "test_user",
        "email": "test_user@google.com"
    }
]
```

Now, You are finish the first mile stone, Congrats!

Let's take the next step by `git checkout step-2`

## Step 2: Hey, there is a BugÔºÅ

Let's back to the code, open `gs-accessing-data-mysql/complete/src/main/java/hello/MainController.java` in your IDE or editor. You can find out the code which handle `add` operation in line 20.

Here is a problem, what will happend if we add a new user with same user and email?

You can make same add request twice then you can get two users with same name and email like this:

```JSON
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "test_user",
        "email": "test_user@google.com"
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "test_user",
        "email": "test_user@google.com"
    }
]
```

The only difference is the ID. The user can have different name but same email, or an email address with different account name, or there a unique user-email pair in the database. No matter what kind of constraint you want, You have to add it.

The constraint in the data model which generated from the user class. Spring boot will create a table for us when we write `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create` in file `application.properties`.

We can add the constraint via annotaion, You can add following line between `@Entity` and `public class User {` to assure user-email pair unique in database.

```Java
@Table(name = "USER", uniqueConstraints = @UniqueConstraint(columnNames = {"Name", "Email"}))
```

Let's rerun the application and make same request twice. It should return an unfriendly message like this:

```JSON
{
    "timestamp": "2018-12-19T14:15:16.304+0000",
    "status": 500,
    "error": "Internal Server Error",
    "message": "could not execute statement; SQL [n/a]; constraint [UKrjpkssy3ogf0vjvjbn7le85qt]; nested exception is org.hibernate.exception.ConstraintViolationException: could not execute statement",
    "path": "/demo/add"
}
```

Anyway we fixed a bug! Let's see how to keep this bug away.

Let's take the next step by `git checkout step-3`

## Step 3: Add automated integration test to keep known bug away!

There is a side affect you may found: when you update the user class(the data model). The Spring will recreated the database when API is launching.

The good thing is you fix a bug. It doesn't matter you loss some valueless test data. We will handle this in later steps.

Now we need to add some automation tests to record this situation and keep this bug away.

There is another good spring guide project named [Spring Boot Actuator](https://spring.io/guides/gs/actuator-service/). Spring Boot Actuator is a sub-project of Spring Boot. It adds several production grade services to your application with little effort on your part. Actually, I don't know what are they added to make it to `production grade`. Whatever, `production grade` to me is `the project worth to learn.`

OK, Let's clone the repo by `git clone https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-actuator-service.git` and open the `complete` folder it in your IDE.

It's another RESTful API example and simpler than we updated above. It just response a stupid "greeting" message. (Why do you need a greeting API? I'd like to have an "I'm fine." API instead.)

The important thing is the automation integration test in `gs-actuator-service/complete/src/test/java/hello/HelloWorldApplicationTests.java`.

You can run the test in your IDE or enter `./gradle test` in your shell. It will launch the Spring Boot and made reqeust via `testRestTemplate.getForEntity` method to simulate user requests.

We can copy the whole file and rename it from `HelloWorldApplicationTests.java` to `ApplicationTests.java` and update the request path to `demo/all`.

Let's run the test.

Opps! You may get the error like:

```Java
org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Error creating bean with name 'hello.ApplicationTests': Injection of autowired dependencies failed; nested exception is java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Could not resolve placeholder 'local.management.port' in value "${local.management.port}"
```

Ah! There must something we missed from actuator project. Comparing these two projects. There is one line missing in `build.gradle` file:

```Groovy
compile("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-actuator")
```

Add this line to the build.gradle file in `gs-mysql-data` and rerun.

Damn it! Another error:

```Java
org.springframework.web.client.RestClientException: Error while extracting response for type [interface java.util.Map] and content type [application/json;charset=UTF-8]; nested exception is org.springframework.http.converter.HttpMessageNotReadableException: JSON parse error: Cannot deserialize instance of `java.util.LinkedHashMap` out of START_ARRAY token; nested exception is com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.MismatchedInputException: Cannot deserialize instance of `java.util.LinkedHashMap` out of START_ARRAY token
 at [Source: (PushbackInputStream); line: 1, column: 1]
```

There is an exception to convert response to Map.class. Let's make it simple: change Map.class to String.class. The method will like this:

```Java
@Test
public void shouldReturn200WhenSendingRequestToController() throws Exception {
    @SuppressWarnings("rawtypes")
    ResponseEntity<String> entity = this.testRestTemplate.getForEntity(
            "http://localhost:" + this.port + "/demo/all", String.class);

    then(entity.getStatusCode()).isEqualTo(HttpStatus.OK);
}
```

Let's rerun the test again.

Yeah! All tests passed!. Let's write the test code again:

```Java
@Test
public void shouldReturn500WhenSendingSameRequestToController() throws Exception {
    this.testRestTemplate.getForEntity(
            "http://localhost:" + this.port + "/demo/add??name=test_user&email=test_user@google.com", String.class);
    ResponseEntity<String> entity = this.testRestTemplate.getForEntity(
            "http://localhost:" + this.port + "/demo/add??name=test_user&email=test_user@google.com", String.class);
    then(entity.getStatusCode()).isEqualTo(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);
}
```

Let's run the test, all passed! Awesome!

Wait, How about the existing data in database ? The test suite will recreate database everytime to keep it clean for your test.

All good, Let's create other CRUD APIs in next step.

Let's take the next step by `git checkout step-4`
